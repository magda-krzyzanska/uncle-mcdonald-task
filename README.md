Hello,
My name is Magda Krzyżańska. I started learning programming after facing a burnout at my previous job- as a physiotherapist.
I am at the begining of my journey with programming, but I find a great joy in finding solutions to problems and making things work. 
Lately learning how to code has been my favourite activity of the day and I cannot wait for it to become my cereer path and a full time job.  
I am really looking forward to an oportunity to join the Motorola Academy!
